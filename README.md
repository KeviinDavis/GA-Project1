# Spaceman Rescue

## Description
**Spaceman Rescue** is an interactive browser-based game where players must guess letters to reveal a hidden word. Each incorrect guess brings the Spaceman closer to being abducted by a mysterious spaceship. The goal is to guess the word before the Spaceman is fully abducted! I chose this concept because it's a fun twist on the classic "Hangman" game, but with a space-themed adventure that adds visual engagement. The game is designed to be simple, fun, and educational by challenging players' word-guessing abilities.
